1. Use `require()` to include all of the required modules for this application.
    - fs, util, and inquirer
2. Create variable lists that will hold all of the information acquired from the user to create the README file`
    - `const readmeData = []`
        - title, description, installation, usage, contributing, tests, license(list, badge), questions(GitHub username and email)
        - table of contents
3. Create a main menu that prompts the user to choose which section they would like to fill out.
    - Create a function called `mainMenu()`
    - Use `inquirer.prompt()` to display a list of menu choices, one of which 'Exits' the menu.
    - THEN use `switch()` to determine which function to run next based on the user's choice.
    - The 'Exit' choice will execute the `generateMarkdown()` function.
4. Create the functions for the `mainMenu()` options.
    - Each function begins with an `inquirer.prompt()` that collects the needed information.
    - That information is THEN passed along to a function that pushes it into the readmeData list in the form of an object.
        - Object structure: {section: 'section', content: 'content'}
    - Each function should conclude by calling the `mainMenu()` function, except `generateMarkdown()`.
